# 🤖 Sandbox Transformers

Hands-on experimentation sandbox for transformer models using PyTorch and Hugging Face.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as a playground for:
- Experimenting with state-of-the-art transformer models
- Testing different NLP tasks and approaches
- Learning about transformer architectures hands-on

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install Conda if you haven't already
2. Create the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
3. Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate sandbox-transformers
```

Note: If you need to update the environment after changes to environment.yml:
```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

## 📚 Tech Stack

- 🔥 PyTorch - Deep learning framework
- 🤗 Transformers - Hugging Face's transformer models
- 📊 Data Science tools - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- 📈 Visualization - Matplotlib
- 📓 Jupyter - Interactive development

## 🚀 Getting Started

After setting up the environment, you can start experimenting with transformers by:
1. Opening a Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`
2. Creating your first transformer experiment
3. Happy coding! 🎉
